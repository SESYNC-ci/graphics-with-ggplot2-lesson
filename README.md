## Visualizing Tabular Data

Plots of tabular data take many common forms--line graphs, histograms, scatter
plots, box plots, etc. The purpose of this lesson is to teach the basic
principles of the ggplot2 package's "Grammar of Graphics", so that creating
visualizations in R begins to seem down-right orderly.
