## Review

1. Call `ggplot` with parameters `data` and `aes` paving the way for subsequent layers.
1. Add one or more `geom_*` layers, possibly with data transformations.
1. Add `labs` to annotate your plot and axes labels.
1. Optionally, add `scale_*`, `theme_*`, `facet_*`, or other modifiers that work on underlying layers.
